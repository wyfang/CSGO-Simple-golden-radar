Personally, I really like the simple gold radar and I use it all the time. But the radar lacks more maps, and I decided to finish adding all the others when I have time, so I hope you like it.

Plans:
Initially use the simple radar style to draw maps, and then constantly update and fix the details of the radar location errors, etc. during my own playthrough.
