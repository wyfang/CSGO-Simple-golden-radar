Personally, I really like the simple gold radar and I use it all the time. But the radar lacks more maps, and I decided to finish adding all the others when I have time, so I hope you like it.

Plans:
Initially use the simple radar style to draw maps, and then constantly update and fix the details of the radar location errors, etc. during my own playthrough.


---------------------------------
How to install

1) Download and open a radar map folder, select and copy all the files inside.

2) Open the map file in the CSGO game directory: (C:\YOUR DIRECTORY\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource\overviews) and paste all the radar.dds files
---------------------------------

Backup.zip is the official default radar file, you can use it if you need to restore.
